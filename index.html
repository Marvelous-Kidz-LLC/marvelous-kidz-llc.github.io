    <h2>WHAT IS ACADEMIC LANGUAGE THERAPY?</h2>
    <p>"Teaching begins with the basics and rebuilds the learning continuum step-by-step. Academic Language Therapy starts from ground zero so that no gaps remain in the student's understanding of language structure. Students learn systematic strategies for decoding (word identification), encoding (spelling), and letter formation."</p>
    <p>Marvelous Kidz employs Academic Language Therapy through a multi-sensory language approach, namely "Sounds in Syllables" developed by Sandra Dillon.</p>
</div>

<div class="effects section">
    <h2>WHY IT WORKS</h2>
    <p>Academic Language Therapy is diagnostic and prescriptive. Students' successes and challenges during one lesson inform the planning of subsequent lessons. Academic Language Therapy is cumulative, systematic, structured instruction that is written and planned for a particular student, or group of students, and is delivered by an educator with comprehensive training.</p>
    <p>In structured literacy, teachers review previously taught concepts in each lesson and introduce new material to keep the student stimulated and engaged.</p>
    <p>Following the advice of Margaret Rawson, a pioneer in the field of dyslexia education, academic language therapists guide their students to progress "as fast as they can but as slow as they must."</p>

<div class="story">
    <p>"Ms. Katherine works as a reading specialist/coach at the school where I work. I had known and worked with Ms. Katherine for several years in this capacity. Last year I had a student that struggled with reading. He had difficulties sounding out words. His decoding skills were slow and laborius. His reading level was 'A' which is way below First Grade reading level. I tried to help him for some time and when I saw no improvement, I referred him to Ms. Katherine. Ms. Katherine worked with him 3 times a week for 7 months. After 2 months, I started seeing a huge improvement in his reading. He was able to sound out words and read sentences. Ms. Katherine was able to develop and implement a remediation plan that focused on fundamentals and helped my student get to grade level. After 5 months, my student's reading level was 'J.' Ms. Katherine improved his self-confidence and instilled in him a love for reading. Now he is in Grade Two and every time I see him, he has a chapter book in his hand. Ms. Katherine's experience and knowledge base regarding instruction is impeccable. She is a valuable resource to both teachers and students in my school."
